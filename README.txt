Stile is a package of helpers and pattern templates for a certain C# idiomatic style.  It enables terser and more English-like code.  Its name is also a bit of a pun: a stile is a feature of a fence designed to let humans pass while still being a barrier to livestock.  (The best known example, probably, being the turnstile.)  

Add some Stile to your code and slip on through to the other side.
